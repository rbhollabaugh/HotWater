We would want to figure out more about your situation before ordering parts. Ideally we would want to check your heating elements with a multimeter for ground faults. 
The heating element is that copper cylinder. It has 4-6 'legs' coming into the bottom of it. You would set a multimeter to Ohms or Resistance. Then you would put one of your multimeter paddles / leads to one of the legs, right where you would put a screwdriver, and then your other paddle / lead to the actual copper tanklet itself. You'd be looking for any resistance readings. If you see anything other than 'OL' or 0 for resistance, then you have a ground fault. 

By the way, be sure to turn ALL the power off to your water heater before testing it with your multimeter for resistance. 
Also, hit the reset button before testing for resistance. Turn the power off to the unit before hitting the reset button. 

If you do not find a ground fault in the heating element and the water heater is still tripping off, then there very well might be a fault of some sort in your computer board.
